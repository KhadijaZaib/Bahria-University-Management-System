# Bahria-University-Management-System
Our 2nd semester group project was the Bahria University Management System, developed by a team of six members. The system aimed to streamline university operations by integrating multiple modules. My key contribution was implementing the E-Library module, which enabled digital access, efficient book management, and user-friendly search features.
